    <h3>Forgot Your Password?</h3>
    <p>
No need to worry — recovering your Golsa account is quick and secure.
<br>
Please enter the email address or mobile number associated with your account in the field below. We will immediately send you a password reset link (or a one-time verification code) to that email or phone number.
<br>
The link will remain valid for 30 minutes and can only be used once, ensuring the highest level of security for your account. Once you click the link, you will be able to create a new, strong password and regain full access to your account, order history, saved addresses, and wishlist.
<br>
Your personal information and previous orders are completely safe and have not been affected.
<br>
If you no longer have access to the registered email or phone number, or if you encounter any issues during the recovery, please contact our Customer Support team directly at support@golsa.ir or via live chat. We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist you personally.
<br>
Thank you for choosing Golsa — we’re happy to help you get back to shopping the finest flowers and plants.</p>
